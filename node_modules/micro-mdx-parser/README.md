# micro-mdx-parser

A tiny parser to convert markdown or HTML into JSON.

Works in the browser & on the server.

The JSON representation can be used to render components.

Fork of https://github.com/andrejewski/himalaya with tweaks to make it MDX-like.

## Install

```
npm install micro-mdx-parser
```

## Why?

I needed a lightweight MDX parser that works in the client for some CMS-related stuff.
