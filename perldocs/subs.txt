NAME
    subs - Perl pragma to predeclare subroutine names

SYNOPSIS
        use subs qw(frob);
        frob 3..10;

DESCRIPTION
    This will predeclare all the subroutines whose names are in the list,
    allowing you to use them without parentheses (as list operators) even
    before they're declared.

    Unlike pragmas that affect the $^H hints variable, the "use vars" and
    "use subs" declarations are not lexically scoped to the block they
    appear in: they affect the entire package in which they appear. It is
    not possible to rescind these declarations with "no vars" or "no subs".

    See "Pragmatic Modules" in perlmodlib and "strict subs" in strict.
